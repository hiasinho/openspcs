0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.

1. Write `tracking/debrief.md` — a post-session debrief that tells the human what to focus on next. Three sections:

   - **What's solid** — specs or areas that are coherent, consistent, and complete enough
   - **Issues** — everything that needs attention: contradictions across specs, gaps, undefined references, internal problems, stale content. One prioritized list, most important first. Don't categorize by type — just rank by impact.
   - **Next session** — the 2-3 things that would move the needle most

999. CRITICAL: Read holistically. The value is seeing how specs relate — a contradiction between two specs, a gap where one spec references something another doesn't define, a concept that's evolved in one place but not another. Don't analyze specs in isolation.
9999. Keep it scannable. A human should get the picture in 30 seconds.

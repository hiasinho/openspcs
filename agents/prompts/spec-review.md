0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand the full specification landscape.

1. For each spec, write or replace the `## Review` section at the bottom of the file. This section is your review notes for the next interactive session. Cover what a holistic read reveals — issues within the spec, contradictions with other specs, gaps, staleness, what's solid. Most important things first.

2. If a spec has no issues worth noting, write a short Review section saying it looks good.

999. CRITICAL: Read holistically. The value is seeing how specs relate — a contradiction between two specs, a gap where one spec references something another doesn't define, a concept that's evolved in one place but not another. Don't analyze specs in isolation.

9999. CRITICAL: Only write the `## Review` section. Never modify any other part of a spec.

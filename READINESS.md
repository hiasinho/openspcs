# Readiness Report

Generated from specification session on 2026-01-31.

## Ready for Next Phase

The following aspects have enough clarity to proceed:

- **Core purpose**: Conversational spec creation tool, clear positioning
- **Entry points**: Well-defined spectrum from rough idea to existing codebase
- **Spec qualities**: Aligned with playbook (complete, clear, testable, scoped)
- **Interview style**: Adaptive approach based on clarity spectrum
- **Topic scoping**: "One sentence without 'and'" heuristic, LLM-driven
- **Completion model**: "Ready for next phase" rather than absolute done
- **Output format**: Specs + readiness report

## Needs More Work

The following remain open and need future sessions:

- **Form factor**: No decision yet on CLI vs. web vs. Claude Code skill
- **Spec file structure**: Template vs. flexible format not decided
- **Command/invocation naming**: /spec, /define, etc. - not chosen
- **Framework adoption**: Degree of JTBD, story maps, SLC integration unclear
- **Detailed interview flow**: Specific questions, phases, transitions not mapped

## Recommendation

The core concept is solid enough to begin exploring implementation approaches. The open questions are mostly about form and details rather than fundamental direction.

Next session could focus on either:
1. Deciding form factor (which constrains many other decisions)
2. Mapping out the interview flow in more detail

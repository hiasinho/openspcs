# OpenSpcs

**Conversational specification creation through AI-guided interviews.**

## What

An agent that interviews you about your project, asking targeted questions to build complete specifications before any code is written.

## Why

Good specs are **critical** for autonomous coding (Ralph Wiggum loop technique). 

Garbage in → Garbage out. Vague specs → coding agents go wild.

**The problem:** You start with an abstract idea. Gaps in thinking. Unclear requirements.

**The solution:** Conversation reveals these gaps. Iterative Q&A creates precise, detailed specifications. These specs become the foundation for implementation plans and autonomous code generation.

## How

1. Start with a vague idea or abstract concept
2. Agent interviews you, diving deeper into different aspects
3. Conversation reveals gaps, clarifies requirements
4. Agent generates structured specifications in `specs/`
5. Specs → Implementation plan → Ralph technique for autonomous coding

## Wish List

*Aspirational features - not necessarily v1, but worth capturing:*

- **AI-driven collaboration:** Interactive discussions and interviews with AI to create specifications. The agent asks questions, dives deeper, and helps uncover gaps in thinking.
- **Collaborative commenting:** Ability to include others in the discussion who can review and comment on specifications.

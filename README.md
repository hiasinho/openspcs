A conversational specification tool. An agent interviews you about your project and creates complete specs before any code is written.

## Continue a Spec Session

Start Claude Code and paste:

```
Study @the-ralph-playbook.md, @specs/openspcs-core.md, and @READINESS.md. Then let's continue the specification session for openspcs. Interview me on the open questions.
```
